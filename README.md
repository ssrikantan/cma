Respond to the Survey questions by selecting the options that represents the 'current' state and a Target 'To-be' State 

* :boom: The Maturity Assessment rating and the Survey questions are not based on any industry Standard or benchmark. It is meant to be used as a self-assessment tool.

## Viewing the 'Assessment' Sheet

Once the Survey is responded to, the 'Assessment' Sheet gets populated with a Spider Chart that graphically represents the current and Target State, across different areas. It gives a bird's eye view of where the gaps are, and identify actions that can lead to filling those gaps. In the 'Comments' section in the sheet, a stakeholder could capture comments and details on the corrective actions required to address the gaps.

## Viewing the 'FollowupActions' Sheet

Based on the Survey response, and the values selected for the 'As-is' and 'To-be' state, certain recommended actions are automatically populated that can help fill the gaps.
